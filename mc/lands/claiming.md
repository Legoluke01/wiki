# Claiming land

## Creating a Land

So, first off, you need to create a Land. To do this, run the following command: `/lands create <name>`

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to create a Land, you need at least $5,000.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Claiming too close to another Land may cause them to start a war with you.
{% endhint %}

## Claiming chunks

There are two methods to claim chunks, one is doing it with commands, and the other is doing it with a golden shovel. Each chunk you claim will increase in cost, it'll stop increasing once it reaches $500.

### Method One: Commands

Simply stand in the chunk you are in and run the following command: `/lands claim`

{% hint style="info" %}
If you didn't create a land initially, it will automatically create a Land named after you.
{% endhint %}

### Method Two: The Claim Tool

When you first joined the server you were provided with a feather and a golden shovel. The golden shovel is your claim tool, and the feather tells you Land information about the block you right-click it on. For this method, you'll need the golden shovel.

Right-click the 2 corners of the portion of land you would like to claim. Once finished, it'll claim the land for you. Keep in mind that it will claim by **chunk**, not by block. So if your selection has one full chunk and half a chunk in it, it will claim both chunks entirely.
