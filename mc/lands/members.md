# Adding/managing members

## Trusting Players

If you want another play to be able to do stuff in your land, you need to **trust** them. Run this command: `/l trust  [area or * for whole land]`

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to untrust a player, run this command: `/l untrust <player> [area or * for whole land]`
{% endhint %}

## Promoting/Demoting a player

In each Land, there are 5 roles; Owner\(You\), Admin, Mod, Member, Nation, and Visitor. The Owner and Admin have unlimited permissions within the Land unless you change the permissions per role. When you trust a player, they will be automatically added to the **Member** role. To change this, do the following:

1. Run `/l`
2. Click on the Players item. \(It should be a villager's head\)
3. Now there should be the head of each player that's in your land.

   a. On the player you want to promote, left-click their head.

   b. If you'd like to demote them, right-click their head.
