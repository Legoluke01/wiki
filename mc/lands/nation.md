# Starting a Nation

What is a nation you say? Well, a nation is basically a collection of more than one Lands. Think of a nation as the U.S., and the Lands being the 50 states.
 
## Starting a Nation
Starting a nation is simple, just run the following command: `/n create <name>`
 
## Trusting Lands
Now that you have a nation, you want to add more lands to it!
To trust a Land, use this command: `/n trust <land>`
*To untrust a Land, simply replace `trust` with `untrust`.*
 
## Nation Wars
Nation wars work exactly the same as Land wars, go read the previous page to get familiarized with it.
 
## Nation Upkeep
So, once a Land joins a Nation, the **land** no longer pays upkeep to the **server**, instead it goes to the **Nation**. However, the **Nation** still has to pay upkeep to the **server**. This is an important part of a Nation because if you don't pay upkeep, you won't be able to have a Nation.
