# Going to war

## Declaring War
Declaring war is quite simple, actually. All you have to do is run the following command: `/wars declare <land>`

It will then ask you about a tribute. This is the amount of money they have to pay if they want to surrender. The enemy will then receive the declaration of war with all the information. They will have 2 days to respond to the decleration.
 
## War Preparation Time
Once the declaration of war is sent, a specific amount of time will start counting down. This is the time you have to prepare for war. If you'd like info on the war, use `/war info`. War preperation time is 1 day.
 
## War
So, once the war starts, both parties will be able to break/place certain blocks. These blocks are vines, ladders, and scaffolding. Both parties are able to kill in each other's land, and loot containers.
 
## End of War
The war will automatically end after 3 days (72 hours). The point of war is not to loot or grief, it's to kill. The land with the most kills wins. The winner gets 75% of the loser's money.

Nation wars work exactly the same as land wars, and yes, a nation can go against a Land and vise-versa.
